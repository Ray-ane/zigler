Dear B3 Data Services Team,

I hope you’re well. My name is **\[Your Name]**, and I represent **\[Your Company]**, where we develop quantitative trading models that rely on detailed derivatives positioning data.

I would like to inquire about accessing, via API or data feed, the **daily long and short open-interest breakdown for the USD Futures contract (DOL), segmented by investor type** (e.g. Institutional, Financial Institutions, Non-Residents, Retail, Others). Specifically:

1. **Endpoint Details**

   * Does B3 offer a REST API endpoint (or SFTP/XML/CSV feed) that returns, for each DOL contract expiry, the number of long contracts and short contracts held by each investor category?
   * If available, could you share the endpoint URL(s), required query parameters (e.g. date, symbol, expiry), and sample request/response payloads?

2. **Authentication & Access**

   * What is the process to register for developer access (sandbox) and subsequently obtain production credentials?
   * Which authentication method is used (e.g. OAuth2 client-credentials), and are there any VPN or dedicated-link requirements?

3. **Data Delivery & Formats**

   * Supported output formats (JSON, CSV, XML) and any options for bulk downloads or end-of-day file delivery.
   * If there’s a proprietary feed (e.g. “PNP”) that includes this per-contract, per-investor-type data, please advise on the specifications and commercial terms.

4. **Commercial Terms & Onboarding**

   * Pricing structure (subscription tiers, per-call fees, minimum commitments).
   * Estimated timeline from agreement signature to data access.
   * Availability of technical documentation, Swagger/UI portal, or onboarding support.

Access to the DOL long/short investor-type breakdown is critical for our risk analytics and strategy calibration. If you need any additional details about our intended usage or technical environment, please let me know.

Thank you in advance for your assistance. I look forward to your guidance on how to proceed with obtaining this data.

Best regards,
